## Overview

With the demand for renewable energy in Indonesia increasing, especially with the development of the new capital city in Kalimantan, suitable areas for a solar panel site was explored.

Constraints considered were photovoltaic potential, conservation areas and slopes. Factors considered were proximity to established roads and to urban areas.

Three suitable sites in the study area were found that were large enough for a 1km2 solar farm. Additionally, a large area of land along the coast also met the conditions for having a productive solar panel farm.
