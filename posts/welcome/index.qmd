## Overview

This was for the Urban Simulation module assignment for the Urban Spatial Science Msc at the Bartlett's Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London.

The aim of this project was to critically assess the resilience of London's Underground network taking into consideration the infrastructural network and then commuter flows.

## Objectives

This project was done using Python programming.

-   Rank important stations by centrality measures.

-   Investigate the impacts of station closures or disruptions through node removal.

-   Create a weighted network by including commuter flows.

-   Explore hypothetical scenarios, including a decrease in jobs in Canary Wharf and their impacts on commuter flows.
