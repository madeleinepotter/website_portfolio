## Summary

This project was for my Data Science for Spatial Systems module as part of my Urban Spatial Science course at CASA, UCL.

The aim of this project was to use machine learning to assess the effectiveness of physical housing factors and demographic factors in predicting carbon emissions from London's residential sector.

## Objectives

This project was completed using Python programming.

-   Clean and manipulate data.

-   Assess for spatial autocorrelation.

-   Include spatial lag to the data for the machine learning models.

-   Create optimal XGBoost and Random Forest models and use.

-   Conduct a permutation features importance to determine which factors had the most predictive power over each machine learning model.

-   Assess the performance on the models using R Squared and root-mean-squared-error values.
